# WaveTheVoice App

**Built on top of Metaplex for easy minting.**
<br />
<br />
During development, two JS packages were created:
- [/js/packages/just-minting](https://github.com/WaveTheVoice/WaveTheVoice-App/tree/master/js/packages/just-minting) - contains only the metaplex code that is needed for minting and will be imported into the main app
- [/js/packages/waveform-nft](https://github.com/WaveTheVoice/WaveTheVoice-App/tree/master/js/packages/waveform-nft) - main frontend app (metaplex web frontend is not used!)

## [/js/packages/waveform-nft](https://github.com/WaveTheVoice/WaveTheVoice-App/tree/master/js/packages/waveform-nft) is WaveTheVoice App

Ð¡reated from scratch using [Vue.js 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) + **Solana Web3.js**.

UI: Tailwindcss + Ant Design

<br />

Currently live on https://app.wavethevoice.art/ (connected to Testnet).
